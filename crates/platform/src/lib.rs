//! Host platform detection for PitaGames.
//!
//! Framework-free by design: the GUI renders what this crate reports and never
//! does detection itself, which keeps the renderer replaceable and the
//! detection testable against fixture directories.
//!
//! M1 ships [`proton`] discovery. GPU detection, the environment compiler and
//! process supervision arrive in M3.
